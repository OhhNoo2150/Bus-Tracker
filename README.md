# Real-Time Bus Tracker

In this project we had to retrieve an API key from mapbox, and plot points in an array detailing bus stops in the city of Boston, the stops should be between MIT and Harvard. (pahk da cah in da yahd..you know you read it in a Boston accent)

give it a go here https://OhhNoo2150.github.io/Bus_Tracker 

## Description

upon visiting the site you should get a map of Boston, when you click the button, the markers should pop up detailing the stops for that bus line. 

## Getting Started
first thing you'll want to head over to www.mapbox.com sign up for an account and get an API key 

### Dependencies 
it depends
### Installing 
you have a couple ways to get this up and running
1. You can copy my code, create individual repositories like I did and set up github pages to access them (make sure that you use the naming convention of index.html or it won't load on the screen.)
2. You can sign up for this bootcamp and they'll show you how to do it
3. you're a programming wizard and can do this on your own cause you don't need a bootcamp you're that great.
### Executing program 
If you don't already have a github profile, you'll want to create one (i'm not sure where you're accessing this from if you don't already have one)
create a repository 
add the files
index.html
styles.css
script.js 
copy the files from my files into those files, add them to your repo, set up github pages and it will run it for you. 
## Help 
I'm a little too new to this to offer much help, double and triple check your code to ensure that you don't miss anything...these things are fickle and only work if it's all the way correct
